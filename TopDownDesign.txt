Things to do:
    
	- Come up with a bot name
    
	- Who ever wants to host the bot has to create the bot profile through Discord
        
		- https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id="bot_ID_here"&scope=bot&permissions=0
        
		- replace "bot_ID_here" with bot ID number (provided when bot profile is created)
    



Discord Bot

Problem: 
    
	- Display steam sale prices
    
	- User input games to master list 
        
		(link directly to game page or steam game title)
    
	- User request for a current game price
    
	- Age restriction on steam



Inputs: 
    
	- game to add to master list
    
	- game price requests



Outputs: 
    
	- All games + Expansion prices 
    
	- Current price upon request
    


Assumptions: 
    
	- Users are idiots



Hand calculations:

    

** - indicates message displayed by bot
    
    

	- !add <gameName> // adds game to MasterList.txt
        
		!add Garry's Mod
        
		**Garry's Mod has been added to the games list**
        
    

	- !price <gameName> // checks MasterList for game, returns current game price
        
		!price Garry's Mod
        
		**The current price for Garry's Mod is $10.99 CDN**
    
    

	- !help // prints a list of commands available to that user
        
		!help
        
		**Available commands**
        
		!add <gameName> // adds a game specified to the list
        
		!price <gameName> // returns current price of game specified
    
    

	// example output
    
		**Garry's Mod has dropped in price to $4.99 CDN**


General Algorithm: 
    
	Checks MasterList.txt - 6 hour intervals
    
	Change price to current price if any difference
    
	Display price change in Discord
